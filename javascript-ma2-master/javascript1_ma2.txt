5. Briefly describe cope in JavaScript.

Scoping is determining where variables, functions, and objects are accessible in your code during runtime.
The scope of a variable is controlled by the location of the variable declaration. There 2 scopes in javascript which is
global scope and local scope. A variable is in the Global scope if itâ€™s defined outside of a function.
Variables declared within a function are in the local scope.
 Local scope is also called function scope because local scope is created by functions in Javascript.
